# Twitter UI <img src="src/assets/twitter-logo.svg" alt="" />

This project is a clone of the Twitter User Interface, built with React and TypeScript.

The React Context API was used to share and manage state across the components without the need to pass props down the tree. A global state was created and the child components were able to consume the data provided in the context such as the selected theme and the tweets' data.

The data used in the project, such as the users and the tweets, are fictional and were created to better exemplify the app's functionality.
